Guide to the Bloomberg Terminal 
ₕₐₘₚₜₒₙ@hamptonism·Jan 20Exposing the truth about the most important software on Wall Street: The Bloomberg Terminal is quite literally the financial systems black box.Launched in 1981 by Michael Bloomberg, it started as a tool for delivering real-time bond data to firms like Merrill Lynch and has evolved into a global financial command center used by over 350,000 subscribers worldwide. The Terminal can cost up $30,000 per year, accounting for 85% of Bloomberg L.P.'s $15 billion total annual revenue alone (2024), ultimately representing the pinnacle of integrated financial technology, combining real-time data streams, proprietary algorithms, and multi-asset class analytics into a unified platform.

Jessie Bloom's Bloomberg Terminal SetupThe Bloomberg Terminal has over 15,000 functions…  of which the average client only uses only 29!  Functions and commands are available for the entire spectrum of finance professionals, including Quantitative Analysts, Portfolio Managers, Hedge Fund Managers, Research Analysts, Traders, Investment Bankers, Risk Managers, Economists and Macro Strategists, Financial Consultants/Advisors, and Academics. Quantitative Analytics:Financial Analysis (FA <GO>): Parses SEC filings (10-K/Q) into normalized statements, computing ratios like EV/EBITDA using vectorized operations.Relative Valuation (RV <GO>:) Employs peer benchmarking via k-nearest neighbors algorithms on fundamental datasets.Earnings Estimates (EE <GO>): Aggregates consensus forecasts from 1,000+ analysts, applying Bayesian updates for revision tracking.More Common functions (type then <GO>):DES: Company description (overview, financials, contacts).RV: Relative valuation (compare peers).GP: Price charts (add indicators like RSI; compare stocks).

●●●●●●●●GP: Price charts (add indicators like RSI; compare stocks).EE: Earnings estimates.ANR: Analyst recommendations.CRPR: Credit ratings.SPLC: Supply chain analysis.WACC: Weighted average cost of capital.There are also Charting and Technical Indicators, Portfolio and Risk Management tools, Screening and Backtesting abilities, the list goes on.Tools like PORT <GO> simulate Value-at-Risk via Monte Carlo methods, incorporating covariance matrices from historical returns. For example, stress testing under GARCH models for volatility clustering.EQS <GO> enables SQL-like queries (e.g., filter stocks where P/E < 15 and ROE > 20%), exporting to Excel via ODBC for integration with Python/R scripts. Backtesting leverages "BTST" for strategy simulation, optimizing parameters via genetic algorithms.Some ₕₐₘₚₜₒₙ certified command functions consist of:The Volatility Surface (OVDV <GO>) is a 3D set of option data that visualizes how implied volatility changes with respect to the option's strike price and maturity.  Instead of using a single volatility value, you can use the volatility from the surface that corresponds to the option's specific strike and expiration. The surface also helps in understanding and managing the volatility skew and smile. A pronounced skew might indicate market fears of a significant move in one direction, while a smile could suggest expectations of high volatility regardless of direction.

OVDV <GO>With the Analyst Recommendations & Research (ANR <GO> you are able to see all the Analyst Recommendations & Research from a wide variety of contributing firms.  Securities are rated by a total metric of 5, and you are able to see what score an individual stock is rated by contributing analysts, and whether they believe it is a “buy, hold, or sell” .

Decoding the Bloomberg Terminal Keyboard: Design, Functionality, and Workflow Optimization:The Bloomberg Terminal keyboard represents a cornerstone of financial technology hardware, engineered for precision and speed in data-intensive environments. This device combines a standard QWERTY layout with bespoke features such as biometric authentication and color-coded keys. Priced at approximately $500–$600, it's optional but highly recommended for users handling real-time data across multiple asset classes. While compatible with standard keyboards via mappings (e.g., F2–F12 for sector keys), the dedicated hardware reduces input friction, making it indispensable on trading floors and in research desks. The keyboard's physical design prioritizes durability and integration within multi-monitor workflows. It features a full-sized layout with embedded Bloomberg Secure Access Technology (BSAT) for fingerprint-based login, ensuring compliance with security protocols like those mandated by financial regulators. Connectivity is via USB, with drivers supporting Windows, macOS, and KVM switches for seamless multi-device use.
